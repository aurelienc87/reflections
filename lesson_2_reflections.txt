What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory is created, containing the working git files
It is necessary to create a repository in order to be able to keep track of changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area only contains the files that will be commited, the working directory contains all the files
the repository contains the different commits
The staging area allows to commit only the files related to a single logical change, instead of all the modified files
