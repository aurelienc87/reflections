When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository can be useful when working on a project with more than one computer, or when working with other people. It's also a way to backup the local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually ensures that the version we're working on remains in the same state all the time. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a fork is a copy of a repository on the GitHub servers to a new repository on the GitHub server.
a clone is a copy of a repository from the GitHub servers to a local machine
a branch is a serie of commits in a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote helps to see if the local branch is ahead or below (or out-of-sync) the remote branch
Fetching the remote branch can be useful to check the content of the remote branch locally, and merge the content of the remote with the local branch offline
