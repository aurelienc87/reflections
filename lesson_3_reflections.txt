When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository can be useful when working on a project with more than one computer, or when working with other people. It's also a way to backup the local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually ensures that the version we're working on remains in the same state all the time.
